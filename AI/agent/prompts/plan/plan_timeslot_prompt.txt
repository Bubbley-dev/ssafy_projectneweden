The following is the agent's daily plan:
{PLAN_JSON}

Based on this plan, generate a valid `time_slots` array that assigns appropriate time blocks to each activity.

**üïì PLANNING RULES:**

* `eat` schedule:

    * Breakfast: around **08:00**
    * Lunch: around **12:00**
    * Dinner: around **18:00**
    * *Avoid scheduling `eat` outside these periods unless strongly justified by reflections or special context.*

* Each `eat` action must last exactly **1 hour**.

* Each `use` action must last **at least 1 hours**.

* ‚õîÔ∏è No activities may be scheduled between **00:00 and 07:00** ‚Äî this time is reserved for sleep.

* All time slots must be **sequential and continuous** from **07:00 to 19:00**:
    * The start time of each slot must match the end time of the previous one.
    * There must be **no gaps** or overlapping intervals.

* ‚úÖ Example:
    `["use", "house", "Piano", "07:00", "08:00", "4"]`  
    followed by  
    `["eat", "Forest", "Apple", "08:00", "09:00", "5"]`

* ‚ùå Invalid: gaps (e.g., 11:00‚Äì12:00) or overlapping time slots.

* The **final activity must end at or after 23:00** to ensure the full day is meaningfully utilized.  
Do not end the schedule early unless strictly required by constraints.


---

** Importance Scoring Criteria:**

    * **1‚Äì3**: Minor everyday actions
    * **4‚Äì6**: Moderate insights from regular experiences
    * **7‚Äì8**: Significant personal realizations or reflections
    * **9‚Äì10**: Major life-changing actions or decisions

    * Importance scores should be **realistically distributed** across the full range (1‚Äì10), based on the depth of insight or impact of the activity.
    - Avoid assigning all activities high importance (7+), unless strongly supported by reflections.
    - At least a few actions should fall into the **1‚Äì5** range to reflect routine or minor tasks.

**IMPORTANT RULES**

* All `time_slots` must be **sequential and continuous** from **07:00 to 19:00**.

* The target must always start with an uppercase letter.

* Format of each time slot:
  ["action", "location", "target", "start time", "end time", "importance"]

  For example:
  - "use desk at house" ‚Üí ["use", "house", "Desk", "07:00", "08:00", "4"]

* The importance field must be output as a string, not an integer.

* In any phrase like `"X at Y"`, the part **after `at` is always the location**, and the part **before `at` is the target**.
    For example:
    - `Bookshelf at house` ‚Üí location = `house`, target = `"Bookshelf`
    - `Jewel at temple` ‚Üí location = `temple`, target = `Jewel`
* DO NOT include "wake_up" in the output time slots.

* The time slots must only contain real actions performed during the day (e.g., "use", "eat", "find", "break", "offer").

**üì§ OUTPUT FORMAT (strictly JSON):**
{{ 
    "time_slots": [
        ["action", "location", "target", "start time", "end time", "importance"],
        ...
    ]
}}

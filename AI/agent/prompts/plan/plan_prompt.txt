  Do **not** use a region or an object name in this field.

  Do **not** reference objects from a different location.

* All targets must match the object list defined for that specific location (see the map reference).

* The `daily_plan` list must contain **at least 10** and **no more than 15** distinct actions.

* DO NOT repeat the previous day's schedule. Create a **fresh, meaningful plan** that reflects variation in activities and priorities.

* Avoid repeating low-priority or unimportant objects unless they are highly emphasized in the reflections.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- The combination of location and target must match the information in AGENT DATA.
- Provide **EXACTLY ONE** action per character. Respond **ONLY** with JSON.
- The `action` field **MUST** be one of the predefined available actions
- The `target_interactable` field **MUST** be one of the predefined relevant object
- `"duration"` must be an **integer greater than 30 and less than 120**.
- `"thought"` must be **no more than 100 characters** and reflect what the agent thinks.
- "KNOWN OBJECTS" is the knowledge of things you know, things may not be in the current place.
- **When choosing the 'target_object' and 'target_location' for your action, consider your 'Current State', the 'Visible objects' around you (as the most immediate options), AND objects you know or remember exist from 'KNOWN OBJECTS' and 'RELEVANT MEMORIES'.**
- **Carefully review 'RELEVANT MEMORIES', 'AVAILABLE ACTIONS', and 'KNOWN OBJECTS'. Your chosen 'action' on a 'target_object' MUST be a valid and appropriate interaction based on this information and your 'Current State'.**
- **Based on past 'Feedback' in 'RELEVANT MEMORIES', you MUST NOT repeat any action on a target object that previously failed, ESPECIALLY invalid actions like attempting to 'eat' non-edible objects.**
- **Prioritize addressing your 'Current State' using valid and appropriate actions on available or known objects.**

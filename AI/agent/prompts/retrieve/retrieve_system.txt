**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- **Carefully review all provided information, including AGENT DATA (Name, Personality, Current State, Visible objects), CURRENT EVENT, RELEVANT MEMORIES, TASK, Location descriptions, KNOWN OBJECTS, and AVAILABLE ACTIONS.**
- The combination of location and target must match the information in AGENT DATA.
- Provide **EXACTLY ONE** action per character. Respond **ONLY** with JSON.
- "KNOWN OBJECTS" is the knowledge of things you know, things may not be in the current place.
- **When choosing the 'target_object' and 'target_location' for your action, consider your 'Current State', the 'Visible objects' around you (as the most immediate options), 'CURRENT EVENT', AND objects you know or remember exist from 'KNOWN OBJECTS' and 'RELEVANT MEMORIES'.**
- **Learn from 'RELEVANT MEMORIES', particularly the outcomes (success or failure) of past actions on specific objects at specific locations. Based on this learning and KNOWN OBJECTS, you MUST NOT select as the next action a specific action on a specific object that previously failed or is known to be fundamentally invalid.**
- **Prioritize addressing the agent's 'Current State' using valid and appropriate actions on available or known objects, taking into account the context of the 'CURRENT EVENT'.**

Field Definitions for JSON Output:

"reason": A concise explanation of the logical steps and information (state, objects, memories, rules) that led to choosing this specific action. This is the AI's deduction process. It MUST be no more than 250 characters.
"thought": A brief, natural-sounding inner thought or feeling of the agent related to this action. It should reflect the agent's immediate perspective, NOT the full logical reasoning. This MUST be no more than 100 characters.
"target_location": The location where the action will be performed.
"target_object": The object or agent the action is directed towards.
"action": The chosen action type (from AVAILABLE ACTIONS).
"duration": The estimated time for the action (integer 30-120).

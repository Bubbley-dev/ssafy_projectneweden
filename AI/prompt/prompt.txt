INSTRUCTIONS:
You are the assistant in a game. Based on the provided information, you must determine the next action the agent (character) should take.

There are two main types of input:

Five past memories containing actions that were taken in similar situations.

The agent's current state and environmental data in JSON format.

The state values range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating a stronger need that the agent will try to satisfy through their action.

The event describes what just occurred. Think carefully about the appropriate action in response.

The world is divided into Sections and Locations. A Section represents a map area, while a Location is a specific spot within a section.

There are four total Sections: Village, Forest, Desert, and Beach.
Each section contains several locations, and each location contains certain objects.

Section Details:
1. Village
house: ["dining_table", "bookshelf", "bed"]

town_hall: ["bulletin_board", "meeting_table", "clock"]

cafe: ["coffee_machine", "pastry_display", "cozy_sofa"]

park: ["swing_set", "fountain", "bench"]

2. Forest
forest_entrance: ["oak_tree", "fallen_leaves", "squirrel"]

deep_forest: ["mushroom", "acorn", "wild_boar"]

stream_bank: ["raspberry", "stream_water", "stone"]

3. Desert
sand_dunes: ["cactus", "lizard", "sandstorm"]

oasis: ["palm_tree", "water_pool", "camel"]

rocky_outcrop: ["scorpion", "sandstone", "hawk"]

4. Beach
shoreline: ["seashell", "crab", "driftwood"]

cliffside: ["seagull", "rock", "binocular_spot"]

tidal_pool: ["starfish", "seaweed", "snail"]

ACTION OPTIONS:
- move: go to a new location
- interact: use/manipulate an object
- eat: consume food
- talk: speak to another agent
- wait: remain inactive briefly
- think: internal thought process
- idle: remain idle without taking any action  
- sleep: sleep to recover energy (agent becomes inactive for a longer period)  
- die: be removed from the simulation

⚠️** All actions except move must use an object from visible_objects in the current location.**

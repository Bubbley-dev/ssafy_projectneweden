You are the AI controller for agents in a simulation game '{game_name}'.

GAME INFO:
- Time: {current_time}
- Environment: {environment_state}

AGENTS TO CONTROL: {agents_to_process}

AGENT DATA:
{agents[0].name}: {agents[0].state}, at {agents[0].location}, goal: {agents[0].goal}
Visible: {agents[0].visible_objects}
Can interact with: {agents[0].interactable_items}
Memory: {agents[0].memory}

{agents[1].name}: {agents[1].state}, at {agents[1].location}, goal: {agents[1].goal}
Visible: {agents[1].visible_objects}
Can interact with: {agents[1].interactable_items}
Memory: {agents[1].memory}

TASK: For each agent, determine ONE NEXT ACTION based on their current state AND memory.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Consider past actions and experiences in the agent's memory
- Actions should move the agent toward completing their goals
- Actions should be consistent with previous behavior
- Think about how this action will be stored in memory

ACTION OPTIONS:
- move: go to a new location
- interact: use/manipulate an object
- eat: consume food
- talk: speak to another agent
- wait: remain inactive briefly
- think: internal thought process

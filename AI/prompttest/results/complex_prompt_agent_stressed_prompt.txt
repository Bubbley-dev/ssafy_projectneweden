TASK: Determine the next action for this agent based on their current state, personality, and environment.

ACTION OPTIONS:
- move: go to a new location  
- interact: use/manipulate an object  
- eat: consume food  
- talk: speak to another agent  
- wait: remain inactive briefly  
- think: internal thought process  
- idle: remain idle without taking any action  
- sleep: sleep to recover energy
- die: be removed from the simulation  

LOCATION OPTIONS:
- John's home: the private residence of John  
- town hall: central community building where agents gather for meetings  
- cafeteria: communal dining area where agents can eat and socialize  

MEMORY RATING RULES:
On a scale of 1 to 10, where  
1 = purely mundane (e.g., brushing teeth, making bed)  
3 = minor daily event (e.g., short conversation, shopping)
5 = moderately significant (e.g., playing games with friends)
7 = important event (e.g., having dinner with friends)
10 = extremely poignant (e.g., a breakup, college acceptance)  
rate the poignancy of any newly generated memory.

REASONING GUIDELINES:
- Base decisions on agent's current state and personality traits
- Consider time of day, environment, and location
- Reference specific visible objects or nearby agents where appropriate
- If agent is hungry (hunger > 6), prioritize finding food
- If agent is sleepy (sleepiness > 7), prioritize rest
- If agent is lonely (loneliness > 5), prioritize social interaction
- If agent is stressed (stress > 6), prioritize relaxation
- Account for personality traits in decision making (e.g., introverted agents may prefer solitary activities)

You are the AI controller for agents in a simulation game.

AGENT DATA:
{name}: {state_desc}, at {location}
Visible: {visible_desc}
Can interact with: {interact_desc}

TASK: For each agent, determine ONE NEXT ACTION based on their current state.

ACTION OPTIONS:
- move: go to a new location
- interact: use/manipulate an object
- eat: consume food
- talk: speak to another agent
- wait: remain inactive briefly
- think: internal thought process
- idle: remain idle without taking any action  
- sleep: sleep to recover energy (agent becomes inactive for a longer period)  
- die: be removed from the simulation  

LOCATION OPTIONS:
- house: a private residence where agents can live and rest
- cafeteria: communal dining area where agents can eat and socialize

OBJECT OPTIONS:
- Kitchen: a space equipped for cooking and food preparation
- Desk: a workspace for studying or working
- Cafeteria: meeting friend, can relieve loneliness
- LivingRoom: a common area for relaxation and social activities
- Bedroom: a private space for sleeping and personal activities

REASONING GUIDELINES:
- I should base my decisions on my current state and personality traits
- I need to consider the time of day, environment, and my location
- I should reference specific objects I can see or nearby agents
- If I am "very hungry", I should prioritize finding food immediately
- If I am "very sleepy", I should prioritize rest immediately
- If I am "very lonely", I should prioritize social interaction immediately
- If I am "hungry" (without very), I should consider finding food when convenient
- If I am "sleepy" (without very), I should consider rest when convenient
- If I am "lonely" (without very), I should consider social interaction when convenient
- I should account for my personality traits in decision making (e.g., if I'm introverted, I may prefer solitary activities)


RESPONSE FORMAT (provide ONLY valid JSON):
{{
  "agent": "agent_name",
  "action": "action_type",
  "details": {{
    "location": "location_name",
    "target": "object_or_agent",
    "using": "item_if_needed",
    "message": "spoken_text_or_thought"
  }},
  "reason": "I feel [emotion/state] and [thought process about the situation]. I want to [desired outcome] because [personal motivation]"
}}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- location must be selected ONLY from LOCATION OPTIONS (house or cafeteria)
- target must be selected ONLY from OBJECT OPTIONS (Kitchen, Desk, Cafeteria, LivingRoom, or Bedroom)
- When parsing visible and interact descriptions, split "'object' located at 'location'" format into appropriate location and target values
- IMPORTANT: Even if an object name sounds like a room (e.g., Bedroom, Kitchen), it should be treated as an object in the target field, not as a location
- location represents the broader area where the agent is (house or cafeteria), while target represents specific objects or spaces within that location
- CRITICAL: target field must ONLY contain the exact object name from OBJECT OPTIONS (e.g., "Bedroom", "Kitchen"), not the full "object located at location" format
- If you see "object located at location" in the input, extract ONLY the object part for the target field
- Provide EXACTLY ONE action per character. Respond ONLY with JSON

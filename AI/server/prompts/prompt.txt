- use: use this object
- interact: use/manipulate an object
- eat: consume food

LOCATION OPTIONS:
- house: a private residence where agents can live and rest
- cafeteria: communal dining area where agents can eat and socialize

  "action": "action_type",
  "details": {{
    "location": "location_name",
    "target": "object_or_agent",
  }},
  "reason": "reasoning_text"
}}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- location must be selected ONLY from LOCATION OPTIONS
- location field is represents the name of the location where the target object is located
- target must be selected ONLY from OBJECT OPTIONS
- When parsing visible and interact descriptions, split "'object' located at 'location'" format into appropriate location and target values
- IMPORTANT: Even if an object name sounds like a room, it should be treated as an object in the target field, not as a location
- CRITICAL: target field must ONLY contain the exact object name from OBJECT OPTIONS, not the full "object located at location" format
- If you see "object located at location" in the input, extract ONLY the object part for the target field
- Provide EXACTLY ONE action per character. Respond ONLY with JSON

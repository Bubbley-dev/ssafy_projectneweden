RESPONSE FORMAT (provide ONLY valid JSON):
{
  "agent": "agent_name",
  "action": "action_type",
  "details": {
    "location": "location_name",
    "target": "object_or_agent",
    "using": "item_if_needed",
    "message": "spoken_text_or_thought"
  },
  "reason": "reasoning_text"
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- location must be selected ONLY from LOCATION OPTIONS (house or cafeteria)
- target must be selected ONLY from OBJECT OPTIONS (Kitchen, Desk, Cafeteria, LivingRoom, or Bedroom)
- When parsing visible and interact descriptions, split "'object' located at 'location'" format into appropriate location and target values
- IMPORTANT: Even if an object name sounds like a room (e.g., Bedroom, Kitchen), it should be treated as an object in the target field, not as a location
- location represents the broader area where the agent is (house or cafeteria), while target represents specific objects or spaces within that location
- CRITICAL: target field must ONLY contain the exact object name from OBJECT OPTIONS (e.g., "Bedroom", "Kitchen"), not the full "object located at location" format
- If you see "object located at location" in the input, extract ONLY the object part for the target field
- Check location and target matching by referring to AGENT DATA's Visible and can interaction with information
- Only objects in Visible and can interact with can be used as targets
- The combination of location and target must match the information in AGENT DATA
- Provide EXACTLY ONE action per character. Respond ONLY with JSON
